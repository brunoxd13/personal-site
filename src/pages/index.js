        already worked with its development using Qt and C ++, test automation
        using Squish and Python and I have also worked on a custom operating
        system using yoct. During my graduation I started to get very involved
        in the area of ​​agility, which is one of the things I like most about
        software development, I always try to apply the concepts of Kaizen
        wherever I go. At the moment I am working and studying web and mobile
